## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7 part - 2
This was my favorite lab because it was the first one where me and my partner were struggling to complete it, but we eventually got it done. Adding inputs or the data from other files was a bit tricky since we had to ask for help for it. I liked both parts of the lab but part 2 was a little bit more difficult for me. Knowing about the parking information was very important.

Lab 10 Part -1
Lab 10 was the shortest lab we had this semester and it was a great day for me and my partner. The lab was short but it was still difficult and tricky to complete. We were able to get it done on the same day, and leave a little bit earlier than usual. We had to use strings and if and for loops.

Lab 8 Part - 1
Lab 8 was one of my favorite labs as well due to the fact of part - 1. Here we used doubles, if’s and for loops. It was also asking us to code the maximum score and minimum score. We had to get the “< >” correct because it would give us errors and the test would obviously fail.
